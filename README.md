# operator-for-redis-cluster

![logo](docs/static/images/logo.png)

The goal of this project is to simplify the deployment and management of a [Redis cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial) in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) environment. It started internally at Amadeus in 2016, where it was initially designed to run on [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/). This is the third version of the Redis operator, which leverages the [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/) framework for operators.
